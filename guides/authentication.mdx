## API Keys

All API requests must include an API key in the `Authorization` header using the Bearer scheme.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_api_key
```

API keys can be generated from the Corebill dashboard under **Organization > Developers**.

## Key Format

API keys follow the format `sk_` followed by a unique identifier:

```
sk_live_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0
```

## Permission Levels

Each API key has one of three hierarchical permission levels:

| Level | Description | Allowed operations |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| `read` | Read-only access | `GET` requests only |
| `write` | Read + write access | `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH` requests |
| `admin` | Full access | All methods including `DELETE` |

Permissions are hierarchical: `admin` includes all `write` permissions, and `write` includes all `read` permissions.

## Company Context

All endpoints (except `GET /companies`) require a `company_id` query parameter. This scopes the request to a specific company within your organization.

```bash
# List customers for a specific company
curl "https://api.corebill.io/v1/customers?company_id=com_abc123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_api_key"
```

To find your company IDs, use the [List Companies](/api-reference/endpoint/list-companies) endpoint.

## Error Responses

Authentication errors return standard HTTP status codes:

| Status | Error | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `401` | Missing Authorization header | No API key provided |
| `401` | Invalid API key | Key doesn't exist or is malformed |
| `401` | API key is disabled | Key has been deactivated |
| `403` | Insufficient permissions | Key doesn't have the required permission level |

```json
{
  "error": "Insufficient permissions. Write access required."
}
```

## Security Recommendations

- Store API keys in environment variables, never in source code
- Use the minimum permission level required for your integration
- Rotate keys periodically from the dashboard
- Use separate keys for development and production environments

## Overview

Customers represent the people or businesses you invoice. Each customer belongs to a specific company and can have multiple invoices, quotes, and projects associated with them.

## Create a Customer

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.corebill.io/v1/customers?company_id=com_abc123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Acme Corp",
    "country": "US",
    "email": "billing@acme.com",
    "city": "New York",
    "currency": "USD",
    "legal_name": "Acme Corporation Inc.",
    "legal_vat": "US123456789"
  }'
```

Only `name` and `country` are required. A unique `slug` is generated automatically from the name.

## List Customers

```bash
# List all customers
curl "https://api.corebill.io/v1/customers?company_id=com_abc123"

# Search by name or email
curl "https://api.corebill.io/v1/customers?company_id=com_abc123&search=acme"

# Paginate results
curl "https://api.corebill.io/v1/customers?company_id=com_abc123&limit=10&offset=20"
```

## Update a Customer

Use `PATCH` to update specific fields:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://api.corebill.io/v1/customers/cus_abc123?company_id=com_abc123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "new-billing@acme.com",
    "status": "active"
  }'
```

<Note>
  The API accepts `email` as a shorthand for `contact_email`, and `phone` as a shorthand for `contact_phone`.
</Note>

## Delete a Customer

Deleting a customer performs a soft delete (sets `deleted_at` timestamp). Requires `admin` permission.

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.corebill.io/v1/customers/cus_abc123?company_id=com_abc123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_api_key"
```

## Overview

Quotes (cotizaciones) allow you to send proposals to customers before creating invoices. They support the same line items, taxes, and discounts as invoices, plus versioning.

## Create a Quote

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.corebill.io/v1/quotes?company_id=com_abc123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "cus_abc123",
    "valid_until": "2025-05-15",
    "payment_terms": "50% upfront, 50% on delivery",
    "items": [
      {
        "name": "Website Redesign",
        "description": "Complete redesign including UX research",
        "quantity": 1,
        "unit": "project",
        "unit_price": 8000.00
      },
      {
        "name": "Monthly Maintenance",
        "quantity": 6,
        "unit": "month",
        "unit_price": 500.00
      }
    ]
  }'
```

## Quote Numbers

Numbers include a version suffix: `{PREFIX}-{YEAR}-{COUNTER}-{VERSION}`

Example: `QUO-2025-00001-1`

When a quote is revised, the version number increments.

## Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `draft` | Initial state |
| `sent` | Sent to the customer |
| `viewed` | Customer has viewed |
| `approved` | Customer approved the quote |
| `rejected` | Customer rejected |
| `expired` | Past the `valid_until` date |
| `converted` | Converted to an invoice |

## Defaults

- `issue_date` defaults to today
- `valid_until` defaults to 30 days from `issue_date`
- `currency` defaults to the company's currency

## Filtering

```bash
# By status
curl ".../quotes?company_id=com_abc123&status=approved"

# By customer
curl ".../quotes?company_id=com_abc123&customer_id=cus_abc123"
```

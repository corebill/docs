## Overview

Companies represent the businesses or brands within your organization. All resources (customers, invoices, quotes, projects) are scoped to a specific company.

An organization can have multiple companies, which is useful for agencies or freelancers managing multiple brands or clients.

## Company Context

Every API request (except listing companies) requires a `company_id` query parameter:

```bash
GET /v1/customers?company_id=com_abc123
```

## List Companies

Retrieve all companies accessible with your API key:

```bash
curl "https://api.corebill.io/v1/companies" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_your_api_key"
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "companies": [
      {
        "id": "com_a1b2c3d4e5f6",
        "name": "My Agency",
        "slug": "my-agency",
        "currency": "USD",
        "invoice_prefix": "INV",
        "quote_prefix": "QUO",
        "logo_url": "https://...",
        "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
